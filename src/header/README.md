# The `header` component

Use the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API)
to animate the `<details>` element in the header.

This component doesn't provide any other functionality related to the header.
If JavaScript is turned off in the web browser, the `<details>` element is still
functional but with no animation.
